âœ¨ Beautiful To-Do List Web App ðŸš€

I built a To-Do List Web App with a minimalist design, a smooth user experience, and a progress tracker! ðŸŒŸ




ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

âœ” HTML â†’ Structure of the app

âœ” CSS â†’ Stylish design + cool animations

âœ” JavaScript â†’ Handles user interactions




ðŸ”¥ Features:


âœ… Add Tasks - Type and click "Add Task" to insert a new task.

âœ… Edit Tasks - Modify a task with a simple prompt.

âœ… Mark as Completed - Click the âœ” button, and it turns green!

âœ… Delete Tasks - Remove tasks instantly.

âœ… Progress Bar - Updates dynamically as you complete tasks.

âœ… Animated Background - A looping sky video for a relaxing vibe.

âœ… Star Animation - Floating stars for an aesthetic touch.




ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:

The JavaScript functions manage adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks.

The progress bar updates as tasks are completed.

CSS animations add a smooth experience.
